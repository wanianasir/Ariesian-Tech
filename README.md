Here is a detailed description of my project **Simple Calculator using GUI**:
This Python code implements a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)-based calculator** using the `Tkinter` module. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, it supports functionalities like clearing the screen and removing the last character (backspace).

Here’s a detailed breakdown of each part of the code, explaining its purpose and design:

**1.Importing the Tkinter Library**
```python
from tkinter import *
```
- The code starts by importing the `Tkinter` module, the standard Python library for creating graphical user interfaces. We import all its classes and functions to facilitate the creation of the calculator's GUI elements.

---

**2.Global Variables**
```python
first_number = second_number = operator = None
```
- These global variables store the values for the **first operand**, **second operand**, and the **operator** (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`). They are used to hold data across multiple button clicks during a calculation.

---

**3.Functions**

#### `get_digit(digit)`
```python
def get_digit(digit):
    current = result_label['text']
    new = current + str(digit)
    result_label.config(text=new)
```
- **Purpose**: This function is called whenever a digit button (0–9) is pressed. 
- **Functionality**:
  - It retrieves the current value from the calculator display (`result_label`), appends the pressed digit, and updates the display with the new value.

---

#### `clear()`
```python
def clear():
    result_label.config(text='')
```
- **Purpose**: This function clears the display when the "C" (clear) button is pressed.
- **Functionality**:
  - It resets the text of `result_label` to an empty string, effectively clearing the calculator screen.

---

#### `get_operator(op)`
```python
def get_operator(op):
    global first_number, operator
    first_number = int(result_label['text'])
    operator = op
    result_label.config(text='')
```
- **Purpose**: This function is triggered when an operator button (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) is clicked.
- **Functionality**:
  - The value currently on the display is stored as the **first operand** (`first_number`), and the selected operator (`op`) is saved to the global `operator` variable.
  - The display is then cleared, allowing the user to input the second operand.

---

#### `get_result()`
```python
def get_result():
    global first_number, second_number, operator
    second_number = int(result_label['text'])
    if operator == '+':
        result_label.config(text=str(first_number + second_number))
    elif operator == '-':
        result_label.config(text=str(first_number - second_number))
    elif operator == '*':
        result_label.config(text=str(first_number * second_number))
    else:
        if second_number == 0:
            result_label.config(text='Error')
        else:
            result_label.config(text=str(first_number / second_number))
```
- **Purpose**: This function is triggered when the equals (`=`) button is pressed. It performs the calculation based on the operator selected and the two operands.
- **Functionality**:
  - The value currently on the display is stored as the **second operand** (`second_number`).
  - Depending on the operator, the corresponding arithmetic operation is performed, and the result is displayed.
  - For division, if the second operand is `0`, it prevents division by zero by displaying an "Error" message.

---

#### `backspace()`
```python
def backspace():
    current = result_label['text']
    if current:
        result_label.config(text=current[:-1])
```
- **Purpose**: This function handles the **Backspace** operation, removing the last character from the display.
- **Functionality**:
  - It retrieves the current value on the display and slices off the last character, then updates the display accordingly.

---

### 4. **Creating the Main Window**
```python
root = Tk()
root.title('Calculator')
root.geometry('280x380')
root.resizable(True, True)
root.configure(bg='black')
```
- **Purpose**: This part of the code initializes the main application window (`root`) using `Tk()`.
- **Functionality**:
  - The title is set to "Calculator".
  - The window size is set to `280x380` pixels.
  - The `resizable()` method allows the window to be resized by the user.
 

# To-Do List Manager

This **To-Do List Manager** is a simple, user-friendly task management application developed using Python's `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and `sqlite3` for persistent data storage. It allows users to create, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Tasks are stored in a local SQLite database to ensure they persist between sessions.

## Features
- **Add Task**: Users can add new tasks to the to-do list.
- **Edit Task**: Modify existing tasks with new descriptions.
- **Delete Task**: Remove unwanted tasks from the list.
- **Mark as Completed**: Mark tasks as completed with a simple click, visually displaying completed tasks.
- **Task Persistence**: Tasks are stored in a SQLite database, so they remain available between sessions.

## How It Works
1. When the application starts, all tasks from the SQLite database are loaded and displayed in a listbox.
2. Users can type a task description into the input field and click "Add Task" to add it to the list.
3. Select a task from the list and use the "Edit Task" button to modify it or the "Delete Task" button to remove it.
4. To mark a task as completed, simply select the task and click the "Mark as Completed" button. Completed tasks are visually indicated by "[COMPLETED]" next to their description.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-list-manager.git
   ```
2. Install Python if you don’t already have it installed ([Python Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python todo_list_manager.py

### 5. **Creating the Display (Result Label)**
```python
result_label = Label(root, text='', bg='black', fg='white')
result_label.grid(row=0, column=0, columnspan=10, pady=(50, 25), sticky='w')
result_label.config(font=('verdana', 30, 'bold'))
```
- **Purpose**: This is the display area where numbers and results are shown.
- **Functionality**:
  - A `Label` widget is created with a black background and white text.
  - The display spans across all columns in the first row (`columnspan=10`) and has padding applied for better spacing.
  - The font used is **Verdana**, with a large, bold style for visibility.

---

### 6. **Creating Buttons for Digits and Operators**
```python
btn7 = Button(root, text='7', bg='#00a65a', fg='white', width=5, height=2, command=lambda: get_digit(7))
btn7.grid(row=1, column=0)
btn7.config(font=('verdana', 14))
# Similar code for other buttons...
```
- **Purpose**: These are the buttons that the user interacts with to input digits, operators, and perform actions.
- **Functionality**:
  - Each button is created using the `Button` widget, with a custom size (`width`, `height`) and color scheme.
  - The `command` parameter specifies the function to be called when the button is clicked. A **lambda** function is used to pass arguments (like the digit) to the corresponding function.
  - Buttons are placed on the window using the `grid()` method, allowing for a structured layout.

---

### 7. **Adding the Backspace Button**
```python
btn_backspace = Button(root, text='←', bg='#00a65a', fg='white', width=5, height=2, command=backspace)
btn_backspace.grid(row=5, column=0, columnspan=4, sticky='nsew')
btn_backspace.config(font=('verdana', 14))
```
- **Purpose**: This button provides the backspace functionality, allowing users to delete the last entered character.
- **Functionality**:
  - The button has the same styling as other buttons and is placed at the bottom of the grid.
  - The `command` is set to the `backspace()` function.

---

### 8. **Main Loop**
```python
root.mainloop()
```
- **Purpose**: This line starts the **Tkinter event loop**, allowing the application to respond to user inputs. The program will keep running until the window is closed.

---

### Summary
This calculator is a simple yet effective GUI application built using **Tkinter**. It supports all the essential arithmetic operations, including:
- **Addition**, **Subtraction**, **Multiplication**, and **Division**.
- Error handling for division by zero.
- Additional functionalities like **Backspace** and **Clear**.
